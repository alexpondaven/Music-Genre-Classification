# Music Genre Classification
 This project aims to use several models to classify musical genres based on audio samples and different visualisation techniques to understand the data.
 
This project is inspired by the code on https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-project-music-genre-classification/, as seen in the Music Genre Classification jupyter notebook, which implements a K-Nearest Neighbour approach to the problem. That served as a starting point to this project.
